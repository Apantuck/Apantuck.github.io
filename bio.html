        <h1>The Life of Alex Pantuck:</h1>
        <p>
                I was originally born in New Jersey (but please don't tell anyone about it).
                When I was 1, my family moved to LA. <br />
                In truth, I was a slow child. One teacher actually told my mom that I was "retarded" and would never learn the months of the year.But, luckily, my elementary school principle, Joel Pelcyger, was confident that each of us needed to learn at our own pace.Thanks to him, I was able to foster a passionate curiosity and interest in science. And, since then, I have been a succesfull student (even if I do still have to double check the order of the months). <br />
                In middle school (the dark ages), I had my first experience coding at ID-Tech
                summer camp (we made text adventures in C++). Later, in highschool (the slightly
                less dark ages), I took a programming class in Java. Yuck! But still, it helped
                foster my interest in computer science. Thanks Paul Way! <br />
                Then there was an interlude involving an existential crisis (several, actually),
                but I made it out on the other side confident that I wanted to study computer
                science. So here we are. The end?
