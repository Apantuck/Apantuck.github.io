        <h1>The Life of Alex Pantuck:</h1>
        <p>
                I was originally born in New Jersey (but please don't tell anyone about it).
                When I was 1, my family moved to LA.
                In truth, I was a slow child, but, luckily, my elementary school principle,
                Joel Pelsiger, was confident that each of us needed to learn at our own pace.
                Thanks to him, I was able to foster a passionate curiosity and interest in science.
                In middle school (the dark ages), I had my first experience coding at ID-Tech
                summer camp (we made text adventures in C++). Later, in highschool (the slightly
                less dark ages), I took a programming class in Java. Yuck! But still, it helped
                foster my interest in computer science. Thanks Paul Way!
                Then there was an interlude involving an existential crisis (several, actually),
                but I made it out on the other side confident that I wanted to study computer
                science. So here we are. The end?
